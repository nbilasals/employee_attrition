# employee_attrition
this project is to predict the employee attrition
In business, employee attrition is when employees leave the company for whatever reason, either they've found a new job or retired, and haven't been replaced immediately. For a company to be successful, it needs not only to attract top talent but it also needs to retain these talents. For this reason, in this project we'll look into a dataset containing information regarding a certain company's employee list to try to find patterns that may provide useful information in understanding why employees leave and to predict the employee attrition.
